# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that provides personalized movie recommendations to users using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. It analyzes both user preferences and movie attributes to suggest relevant movies. The system is built in Python and utilizes machine learning algorithms for effective recommendations.

## Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to predict user preferences for movies based on:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses the ratings and preferences of similar users to recommend movies.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie metadata (such as genres, cast, crew) to recommend movies similar to those the user has liked.

### Features:
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
- Use of two algorithms: Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering.
- Analysis of a large dataset of movies and user preferences.
- Easy-to-understand implementation in Python using popular libraries.

## Datasets

The system uses two key datasets:
1. **movies.csv**: Contains information about movies including:
   - `movie_id`: Unique ID for each movie.
   - `title`: The title of the movie.
   - `genres`: The genre(s) the movie falls into.

2. **credits.csv**: Contains details about the cast and crew of the movies:
   - `movie_id`: Unique ID corresponding to the `movies.csv` file.
   - `cast`: List of main cast members in the movie.
   - `crew`: List of crew members, such as directors and writers.

Both datasets are required to generate meaningful recommendations based on both user behavior and movie attributes.
