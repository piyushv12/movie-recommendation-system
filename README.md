# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to suggest personalized movie recommendations for users.The recommendation system is powered by data from the provided datasets (movies.csv and credits.csv), which include information about movies such as genres, cast, and crew. Users can search for movies and get personalized recommendations based on genres or cast similarities.

## Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to predict user preferences for movies based on:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses the ratings and preferences of similar users to recommend movies.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie metadata (such as genres, cast, crew) to recommend movies similar to those the user has liked.

### Features:
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
- Use of two algorithms: Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering.
- Analysis of a large dataset of movies and user preferences.
- Easy-to-understand implementation in Python using popular libraries.

## Datasets

The system uses two key datasets:
1. **movies.csv**: Contains information about movies including:
   - `movie_id`: Unique ID for each movie.
   - `title`: The title of the movie.
   - `genres`: The genre(s) the movie falls into.

2. **credits.csv**: Contains details about the cast and crew of the movies:
   - `movie_id`: Unique ID corresponding to the `movies.csv` file.
   - `cast`: List of main cast members in the movie.
   - `crew`: List of crew members, such as directors and writers.

Both datasets are required to generate meaningful recommendations based on both user behavior and movie attributes.
